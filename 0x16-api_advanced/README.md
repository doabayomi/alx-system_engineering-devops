## API Advanced 
the advanced API section for the ALX SE program

### Notes
For those wondering why my functions are somewhat longer than they should be. Lemme give you some lore. ALX is facing an issue with Reddit API for one of their project as of now (September 2024) an d basically forcing everyone to use OAuth. I was trying to bypass the checker by getting the token in the function and using the token to make calls. The token is saved on my Drive. 

It didn't work because I think the checker uses a different mechanism to confirm my code rather than just replicating my code file for their tests but I am quite close. (I feel it!)
